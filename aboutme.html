			<p>"What insights...about our human psyches appear when we return to Earth, when we remember that we are related
			to everything that has ever existed, when we reinstall ourselves in a world of spring-summer-fall-winter, volcanoes,
			storms, surf, bison, mycelium, Moon, falcons, sand dunes, galaxies, and redwood groves? What do we discover about 
			ourselves when we consent again to being human animals -- bipedal, omnivorous mammals with distinctive capabilities for 
			self-reflexive consciousness, dexterity, imagination, and speech? In what ways will we choose to live when we fully 
			remember the naturalness and ecological necessity of death? Who will we see in the mirror when we face up to the present-day 
			realities of human-caused mass extinction, ecosystem collapse, and climate destabilization? And what mystery journey will
			unfold when we answer the alluring and dangerous summons now emanating from the human soul, from the dream of the Earth, and
			from an intelligent, evoloving, ensouled Universe?</p>
			<p>Beyond insights into the nature of our humanity, what will we discover - or remember - about the most effective methods for
			cultivating our human wholeness once we liberate psychotherapy, coaching, education, and religion from indoor consulting rooms,
			classrooms, and chruches? <i>What happens when we rewild our techniques and practices for facilitating human development - not by
			merely getting the out the door and onto the land or waters, but, much more significantly, by fashioning approaches in which
			our encounters with the other-than-human world are the central feature?</i> What happens, in other words, when we allow nature
			itself to be the primary therapist or guide, while the human mentor or advisor becomes more of an assistant to nature, an agent
			or handmaiden of the wild?
