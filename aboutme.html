			<p>Hey yin's and y'alls beautiful people, I'm Brad.</p>
				<p>I'm entering my 14th anniversary of my 28th trip around the sun in April...for the math-challenged that's 41, ugh but it's just a number right? RIGHT?)</p>
				<p>cis-hetero/straight/white typical [but never average] dude</p>
				<p>Aries cusp Leo</p>
				<p>Enneagram 5w4 sx/sp/so</p>
				<p>I/E-NTP (so far but stay tuned)</p>
				<p>solid deconstuctionist/reconstructionist</p>
				<p>I'm a Holy mischief vagabond mystical contemplative activist neo-monastic intergalactic explorer missionary and metaphysical time traveling entrepreneur seeking Truth and practicing prophetic imagination in the name of Gospel Justice. And solidly non-religious but super duper spiritual (and yes it gets me in trouble often if you couldn't tell).</p>
				<p>I’m a walking talking WIP (work-in-progress) in real life and don’t fit well into boxes. I’ve a hell of a story of which I don’t regret anything because even though by most people’s definitions I’ve made more than my share of mistakes I’m still loved by the One That Matters and forgiven and who cares amiright. And I don’t regert any of it because it’s made me the person I am today.</p>
				<p>I’ve done and seen and been a lot of different things - my mission statement has always been to live as many lives as possible in these 80 years I have on Earth.</p>
				<p>Grew up in a broken family trying their best, but in a very unhealthy fundagelical environment, which I do and will continue to wrestle through because the church needs me (us really, all of us here scattered about but finding each other in these eCommunes on the borderlands of faith) more than I/we need the church. Don’t forget that, no matter what you believe.</p>
				<p>Firmly embody the sentiment that ‘not all who wander are lost’ for this is my journey. After a rough kidhood I went out and took life by the horns...but then it took me. L-i-v-i-n. Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you nahmean?</p>
				<p>I’ve been solidly journeying in missions and ministry for the past couple of years, finding myself and my community and learning that we are far and few between IRL. But that just makes connecting even more special.</p>
				<p>Aw shit, I don’t know what to say. My story is our story is your story. We all have more in common than we don’t. I just wish sofa king hard that people would live it already. The world is waking folks, and morning’s a bitch.</p>
				<p>I’m currently in CT but I don’t know how long that will last, couple more months unfortunately at least, but not more than ASAP. I can be found in cool places with interesting people, usually lately mostly international, I've been kicking around Albania and Finland, Maybe the UK this year we'll see. I would say come visit anytime, wherever I am you have a home.</p>
				<p>I travel. I sport. I eat. I’m human (*GASP) well sometimes, and I’m growing and learning, especially that relationship is really important to me and necessary and missing in the world.</p>
				<p>I’m still very much putting it all together, and I probably never will have it, but them’s the adventures wit Jeebus so I’m down.</p>
				<p>Seriously get at me anytime, especially if you’re in a hard spot and need someone to talk to.</p>
				<p>Peace out</p>
